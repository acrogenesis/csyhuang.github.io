I'm switching from a traditional html webpage builder to Jekyll user! Hope to update more often!

I set up Jekyll in my Mac OS X with [homebrew](http://brew.sh),  [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

To see how to set jekyll up on Windows, refer to my [older post]({% post_url 2017-02-12-jekyll-on-windows %}).
