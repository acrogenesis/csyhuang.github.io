I have updated my python library [hn2016_falwa](http://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa) to 
v0.2.0 (see [release note](https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa/releases/tag/v0.2.0)! Now 
it includes functions to compute the contribution of non-conservative forces to wave activity.

Moreover, the [documentation page](http://hn2016-falwa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) generated 
with Sphinx is now hosted on readthedocs.org! Check it out!
