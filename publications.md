**Huang, C. S. Y.**, & Nakamura, N. **Local wave activity budgets of the Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks in the northern winter.** [Supporting Materials]

- The LWA and flux convergence expressions introduced in Huang and Nakamura (2016) are applied to study storm track variability over North Pacific and North Atlantic in both seasonal and subseasonal time-scales.
- Seasonal mean budget of LWA reveals that the low-level meridional heat flux is the major source of LWA over both storm tracks.
- On synoptic timescales the horizontal LWA flux convergence and diabatic heating play the leading roles in the LWA budget.
- Convergence of the meridional eddy momentum flux describes the covariation of barotropic zonal wind and LWA over the Pacific but not the Atlantic.

- A quasilinear 1D theory based on the conservation of local wave activity predicts that no steady wavetrain can be maintained where the westerly zonal flow is decelerated below one half of the initial value.
- Fully nonlinear, high-resolution 2D calculations show that the wavetrain indeed undergoes a significant transformation once the zonal flow along the jet axis is decelerated below the threshold.
- Whether the discontinuity in the basic-state of PV is due to (i) vorticity profile and (ii) layer thickness variation, determined the subsequent evolution of the flow.
- In the latter case (layer thickness variation), the incident wavetrain is blocked and split into two tracks at the stagnation point.

- We generalized the finite-amplitude wave activity proposed in Nakamura and Zhu (2010) to a longitudinally local quantity.
- The Local finite-amplitude wave activity (LWA) identifies both the locations and magnitudes of anomalous wave events (e.g. blocking, wave breaking).
- The LWA flux expression we derived in Quasi-geostrophic (QG) framework consists of a non-linear advective flux and the generalized E-P flux.
- The LWA satisfies an approximate non-acceleration relation, i.e. the sum of zonal wind and LWA is approximately conserved when averaging across a wave packet.
- We compare our theory with the eularian formalism of Kilworth and McIntyre's (1978) local wave activity diagnosing a barotropic decay in a shear flow.
- The block that steered Sandy in-shore in Oct 2012 is examined using ERA-Interim data. The deceleration of zonal flow over the block was half of the growth in LWA, implying the role of non-conservative processes fueling the formation of the block.

Nakamura, N. & **Huang, C. S. Y.** **[Generalized Dispersion Relation and Critical Lines for a conservative, finite-amplitude Rossby wave in Slowly Varying Barotropic Shear Flow.](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~nnn/Nakamura_Huang.pdf)**

- The definitions of both pseudoenergy and pseudomomentum are reformulated in the framework of finite-amplitude wave theory.
- The zonal phase speed of finite-ampltude wave is given by the functional derivative of pseudoenergy with respect to pseudomomentum.
- The theory is tested in a model of barotropic decay in a shear flow. Phase line reconstruction with the theoretically given phase speed resembles the observed phase line patterns, except in regions where the meridional eddy momentum flux changes sign.
