My name is Clare, Shao Ying Huang. (FYI, "Shao Ying" is my legal first name, while "Clare" is my aka.) I am a graduate student in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences in the University of Chicago. I work with Professor Noboru Nakamura on the theory and diagnostic of finite-amplitude atmospheric Rossby waves in the mid-latitudes.

Prior to attending graduate school, I spent my first 21 years of life in Hong Kong. I obtained my B. Sc. degree in Physics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong with double-minor in Mathematics and German Languages.
