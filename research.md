The plantery-scale meanders of jet streams in midlatitudes are known as atmospheric rossby waves. The alternating pressure systems (cyclones/anti-cyclones) migrating along determine the local weather conditions.

My research focuses on a diagnostic theory called the finite-amplitude local Rossby wave activity (FALWA) theory. It can characterize Rossby waves of arbitrary shapes and amplitudes, which goes beyond the scope of traditional linear Rossby wave theory. The figures below show the (left) quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity and (right) FALWA computed from it for a blocking event (i.e. persistent anticyclone) over the Atlantic.

The diagnostic not only capture the life-cycle of finite-amplitude wave events (e.g. blocking and wave breaking), it also connects their evolutions to the generalized wave activity fluxes. This allows the partitioning of contributions from multiple atmospheric processes (e.g. heat flux and advective fluxes) to the evolution (i.e. wave activity budget) of finite-amplitude wave events.
