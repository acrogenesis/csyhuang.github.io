### [Python Library: hn2016_falwa](http://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa)

The finite-amplitude local wave activity (FALWA) theory is a diagnostic framework that can (1) quantify the intensity of atmospheric Rossby waves, even when wave packets are irregular in shape, and (2) characterize the contribution of multiple atmospheric processes on these waves. Factors such as advection by wind field, heat flux exchange, etc. are now identifiable utilizing this diagnostic tool.

The *hn2016_falwa* library include functions that can compute FALWA, and also related semi-lagrangian quantities like equivalent latitudes and eddy-free zonal reference states. Please refer to the documentation of the library for usage and references.
