### [Python Library: hn2016_falwa](http://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa)

The finite-amplitude local wave activity (FALWA) theory is a diagnostic framework that can (1) quantify the intensity of atmospheric Rossby waves, even when wave packets are irregular in shape, and (2) characterize the contribution of multiple atmospheric processes (e.g. advection by wind field, heat flux exchange) on these waves.

The *hn2016_falwa* library include functions that can compute *FALWA* and related semi-lagrangian quantities proposed by my thesis advisor Nakamura and his collaborators, such as *equivalent latitudes* and *eddy-free zonal reference states*. Please refer to the documentation of the library for usage and references.
