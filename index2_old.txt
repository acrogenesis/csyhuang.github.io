### [Python Library: hn2016_falwa](http://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa)

The finite-amplitude local wave activity (FALWA) theory is a diagnostic framework developed in my thesis work that can (1) quantify the intensity of atmospheric Rossby waves, even when wave packets are irregular in shape, and (2) characterize the contribution of multiple atmospheric processes (e.g. advection by wind field, heat flux exchange) on these waves.

The *hn2016_falwa* library include functions that can compute *FALWA* and related semi-lagrangian quantities such as *equivalent latitudes* and *eddy-free zonal reference states*. See documentation for details.

### [Mini Data-Science Project: "Predicting Excitement at DonorsChoose.org"](http://github.com/csyhuang/DSaPP_RA_Project)

This is a side-project I worked on to apply for joining the [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/) program at UChicago as a part-time RA. It contains a short exploratory data analysis and a simple predictive model using logistic regression.

### [Webpage scrapping/Data retrival: ColumnAmountO3](https://github.com/csyhuang/ColumnAmountO3)

The python script *Aug7_2016_AutoRetrieval.py* in this repository (1) scrap the data file links, (2) downloading and (3) converting the satellite data (.he5) obtained by the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) into ascii files. October 2, 2015 was the day with annual maximum Antarctic ozone hole. *(Note: NASA has changed the data retrieval protocol and requires credentials for downloading after the Rossbypalooza workshop, when the data was used. The script has to be updated to accommodate that.)*
